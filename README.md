# xataio/feedback
_A place to collect user feedback. No stupid questions!_

As we’re growing, we’ve got quite a few users now that we’re thankful for and we’re working to create a more communal experience where Xata users can start discussions and monitor their status. To do this, we’ve created this shared GitHub repo between Xata and all of our users. This is a public repo for everyone’s feedback on Xata, so feel free to open and follow discussions here.

# What to Expect
- ✅ Discussions are [created](https://github.com/xataio/feedback/discussions/new) by you and other users, outlining feature requests, bugs, or other ideas
- ✅ Discussions receive a response from Xata in a reasonable time with action items
- ✅ Discussions are resolved and you are unblocked

We’re so happy to have you in our early community. :raised_hands:
