# xataio/feedback
A place to collect user feedback. No stupid questions! As we’re growing, we’ve got quite a few users now that we’re thankful for and we’re working to create a more communal experience where Xata users can flag issues and monitor their status, along with other issues that other users have and Xata’s response to them. To do this, we’ve created this shared GitHub repo between Xata and all of our users. This is a public repo for everyone’s feedback on Xata, so feel free to open issues and follow discussions here.

# What to Expect
- ✅ Issues are created by you and other users, outlining feature requests, bugs, or other ideas
- ✅ Issues receive a response from Xata in a reasonable time with action items
- ✅ Issues are resolved and you are unblocked

We’re so happy to have you in our early community. :raised_hands:
